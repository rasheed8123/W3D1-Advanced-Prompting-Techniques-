    "output": "To solve the equation `2x - 7 = 15`, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. First, add 7 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with `x` on one side:\n   `2x - 7 + 7 = 15 + 7`\n   This simplifies to `2x = 22`\n\n2. Then, divide both sides by 2 to solve for `x`:\n   `(2x)/2 = 22/2`\n   Simplifying this expression gives us `x = 11`\n\nSo the solution to the equation is `x = 11`. This means that if you substitute `x = 11` back into the original equation, it will be true:\n\n`2(11) - 7 = 15`\n`22 - 7 = 15`\n`15 = 15`, which is true."

Given that it took 1.5 hours to travel 60 km, we know that it's been 1.5 hours in total (since no other time information is provided).\n\n2. Next, we convert the distance into kilometers per hour (km/h) which is the standard unit for speed. To do this, we divide the total distance by the total time taken:\n\n   Speed = Total Distance / Total Time\n\n3. Plugging in the values from the problem:\n\n   Speed = 60 km / 1.5 hours\n\n4. Perform the division:\n\n   Speed = 40 km/h (approximately, since we're dealing with whole numbers)\n\nSo, the train's speed is approximately 40 kilometers per hour."
