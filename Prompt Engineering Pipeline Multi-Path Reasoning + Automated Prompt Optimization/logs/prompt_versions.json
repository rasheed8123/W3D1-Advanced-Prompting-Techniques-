      "Solving step-by-step:\n1. Begin by identifying the given expression and its variables. In this case, we have \"2(x + 3)\" as the expression and \"x + 3\" and \"16\" as the variables. \n2. Solve for x using the given values for x + 3 and multiply both sides by 2 to get:\n   (2 * x + 3) = 16\n3. Substitute the given values into the expression to get:\n   (2(x + 3)) = 16(3)\n4. Next, we need to rearrange the order of the parentheses and simplify the left-hand side by using distributive property (2(x + 3) = 2 * (x + 3)). So:\n   (2(x + 3)) = 2 * (x + 3)\n5. Lastly, we need to solve for x in terms of the given values and use the initial substitution of x + 3:\n   x = (-1/6) + 3\n6. Once we have x, we can plug it back into the original expression:\n   2(x + 3) = 16(-1/6) + 3\n7. The equation is now solved for x by combining (2*x) - (1/6) = 16 and (-1/6) + 3 = 0, which gives us:\n   2(x) = 16 + 3(-1/6)  (or equivalently, 2(x) = 55/6(-1/6))\n8. Plugging in x to the original expression and simplifying with algebra, we get:\n    48 - 48 = 0  (because 2(x) + 55/6 = 48), so x is equal to (-1/3) + 4/5\n9. Finally, plugging in x into the original expression gives us: \n    (x + 3) = 2(-1/3) + 4/5\n10. So, we can substitute both sides of the equation to get: 2(x + 3) = (-1/6) + (4/5)(-1/3), which simplifies into: \n    (1/3 + 2/5/(-1/3)) = 0, or equivalently, 1/3 - 2/5 = 0. That is, we have that the equation can be rewritten as 2(x) = (-1/6) + (4/5)(-1/3), which gives us:\n    x = (-1/6) + (4/5) * 0 - 1/3 * 1 = (-1/6) + (-2/5) * 1 = -7/6",
      "To solve the given equation, we first need to identify its variables. In this case, the variable \"x\" refers to the second term on the right-hand side (RHS) of the equation, while the variable \"3\" is referred to as the constant on the RHS. Now that we have identified the variables, we can proceed with solving the equation.\n\nIn step 1, we need to determine which terms are multiplied or divided by the constant on the right-hand side (RHS). In this case, since both sides of the equation have a constant \"3\" added, the first term (2) multiplied by the second term (x + 3) will be equal to the sum of two terms multiplied by the same constant.\n\nSo, we would like to find:\n1. Terms multiplied by \"3\": 2 * 3 = 6 (first term) + 6(1 + 3) = 15 (sum of first two terms)\n2. Terms divided by \"3\": 2/3 = 0.6666 (third term) / 3 = 0.333 (second term) / 3 = 0.333 (first term) = 16/18\nSo, the answer to the question is: The second term on the right-hand side (RHS) is equal to 16/18 multiplied by the constant \"3\" added to both terms multiplied by the same constant.",
      "To solve the given problem, we need to follow these steps:\n1. Break down the expression into its component parts: 2(x + 3) = 16\n2. Write each part separately as a separate step: 2x + 3 = 15 (x + 3) = 16 - (x + 3)\n3. Multiply the two parts and add them together to solve for x: (2x + 3) = 15 * (16 - (x + 3)) + 16\n4. Use the given information in the problem to simplify the expression: 2(3 + x) + 16 = 17 (2 + (3 + x)) + 16\n5. Divide both sides by the unknown constant to solve for x: 2(3 + x) + 16 = 18\n6. Subtract 18 from each side to get the answer: 2(3 + x) - 18 = 0 (x + 1 = 0)",
      "Sure, here's how you can solve the problem:\n\n1. Divide both sides of the equation by 2: $(2(x+3)) = 16/2$.\n    So, $(2(x+3))$ = $16$ / $2$.\n    This is equal to: $((x+3) + 1)/2 = 16 / 2$.\n    Multiplying both sides by $-1$, we get: $(-1)((x+3) + 1) = -16.$ (This is the same as: $x + 3 + 1 = -16.$)\n    So, either $-1$ or $x$ are constants, and $3$ is one of these. Therefore:\n    $(-1) = (-1)^(-1) = -1$. (This shows that $-1$ is a constant.)\n    Substituting this in the original equation, we get: $2(x+3) = -16$.\n    So, $x + 3 = -16/2$.\n    Now, we have the following information: $(2(x+3)) = 16/2$, and $-16/2$ is a constant. Therefore:\n    $2(x+3) = (16/2)(-1)/2$.\n    This is equal to: $2(0.5)(-1)/2 = -8.$",
      "To solve the given equation, let's break it down into its individual parts:\n- 2 (3 + x)\n= 16 (x + 3)\n\nThis is a mathematical expression called an algebraic expression. To solve this equation, we need to determine the value of each term in each part, or variables. In this case, since we have two terms on either side of the = sign, we need to find the values of x and 3 separately. Let's do that:\n- 2 (3 + x) = 16 (x + 3)\n= 16 + 2 * x + 3 * x^2 = 16 + 2 * x + 9 * x^2\n\nUsing this equation, we can calculate the value of each variable by substituting different values for x and 3:\n- 2 (3 + x) = 16 + 2 * x + 9 * x^2 = 16 + 2 * x + 9 * (x + 1)^2\n= 48 + 2 * 5 + 4 * (3 - 2)^2 = 48 + 170\n\nNow we have the value of 2 and the values of x and 3, which we can use to find the value of 16:\n- 2(x + 3) = 16 + 2 * (x + 3)\n= 48 + 2 * (5 + 9) = 48 + 74\n\nThis is the solution to the given equation."
